					<h4>People with Urban Hukou Retire Much Earlier Than Rural People</h4>
						<p>Hukou is an important definition to know the difference between the two systems. It is a record in the system of household registration required by law in China. Often, people who are bon in rural areas have rural hukou.</p>
						<p>The difference can be easily seen from the employment rate with age changing. The share of population that works not surprisingly declines with age, but <b><i>the sharpest decline occurs in the 50s and early 60s for those with urban hukou and not until after age 65 for those with rural hukou. </i></b></p>

					<div class="col-12">
						<p>For those with <span id="call_hukou" style="color:#005f91; text-decoration: none;">urban hukou</span>, the employment share declines from nearly 80% at age 45-49, to about 40% at age 55-59 and 20% at age 60-64. In sharp contrast, for those with <span class="call_hukou" style="color:#ea6948; text-decoration: none;">rural hukou</span>, the most people work even at age 65-69, with rates not declining to below 20% until after age 80. These large disparities suggest that there are significantly different institutions affecting retirement for urban and rural citizens. With respect to retirement behavior, urban China looks like many European countries, while rural China looks like many developing countries.</p>
						<p><b><i>Gender differences in employment rates are much larger for urban hukou holders than for rural hukou holders.</i></b> For those with urban hukou, a large gender gap in labor force participation appears at age 50-54. Over 75% of men work and less than 45% of women work. At older ages, urban women continue to leave the labor force; by age 60-64 less than 10% are working. Urban female rates of labor force participation at older ages are extremely low by international standards. For those with rural hukou, there is a consistent (approximately) 10% gender gap in labor force participation rates, with fewer women working than men. However, a majority of women are still working at age 65-69. </p>

					<p><b><i>The pension benefits of new programs are very modest, while those provided by government or firms are very generous.</i></b> The table bellow reveals the great disparity in benefit levels across programs as well as the share of the population participating in different pension programs. The pension insurance of median annual pension benefits of the <span id="call_new"><b>new rural pension program</b></span> residents is just 111 to 186 dollars, while those from <span id="call_gov">government or public agencies (3,713 dollars) and firm pensions (2,785 dollars)</span> are much greater.

					<p>From the all the elderly who receive any pension benefits, 21.6% receive benefits from one of the <span id="call_main">two main public pension programs</span> for urban workers, 10.7% from the firm basic pension program and 10.9% from the government or public agency worker pensions program. Thus, just as for medical insurance programs, pension programs provide very different benefit levels and thus remain highly segmented. So it is difficult to integrate programs or pool program finances in a way that will facilitate labor mobility. </p>

					<h4>Urban Elderly Are More Often Givers than Receivers of Financial Assistance</h4>
					<p>Different kinds of money transfer are playing quite different roles between the <span style="color: #ea6948; text-decoration: none;">rural</span> elderly and the <span style="color:#005f91; text-decoration: none;">urban</span> elderly. For the rural people, financial support from other household members and private transfers (mainly from children) is important to reduce consumption poverty. The poverty rate based only on the income of respondents and spouses is 65.1%, which falls to 46.1% using pre-transfer household income per, and further to 40.3% with private transfers. Public transfers reduce poverty by 3.3%, and savings reduces poverty from 37.0% to 28.9%.</p>

					<p><b>Expansion of the rural pension program could play an important role in reducing elderly poverty.</b> 25.6% of the rural people are receiving pensions under the new rural social pension program. These people with a poverty rate of 29.6% would have reported a poverty rate of over 37.0% if they had not received the pensions. However, if children reduce the money transfered to their parents when pension becomes available, it could offset the beneficial impact of the program. </p>
					<p>For those with urban hukou, consumption poverty rates are lower, and only coresidence has a marked impact on reducing poverty. But to the contrast of the situation in rural place, <b>private transfers actually increase the poverty rate</b>, which means that the urban elderly are more often givers than receivers of financial assistance. Public transfers and own saving each contribute a small amount to reducing poverty rates.</p>

					<h4>Economically and Socially Deprived Groups Are More vulnerable to Health Shocks</h4>											
					<p>Health insurance coverage rates are lower among the poor elderly, especially those with urban hukou, and among those living alone. Although health insurance coverage (medical relief included) rates are high for all groups, for those with urban hukou, the coverage rate for the poor elderly is 6.0% less than for the nonpoor elderly. </p>

					</div>	
					<p>For those living alone, the coverage is 5.3% lower than those not living alone. For the rural-hukou people, health insurance coverage rates are 2.6% less for the poor elderly than the nonpoor and 6.1% less for those living alone than for those not living alone. Thus, economically and socially deprived groups also face greater vulnerability to health shocks. </p>
